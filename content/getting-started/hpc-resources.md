## Cloud Servers

These clusters are hosted on the Nectar cloud. Email 
[jchung@unimelb.edu.au](mailto:jchung@unimelb.edu.au) to request an account.

When using these servers you should follow the best practices described in
[these documents]({{%relref "best-practices/_index.md"%}}).

Each server has approximately 10 TB of storage space which is not backed up.
It is your own responsibility to have 
[backups]({{%relref "best-practices/backing-up-your-data.md"%}}) of your 
important data.

## Melbourne Bioinformatics HPC

Projects can also apply to get access to the Melbourne Bioinformatics clusters,
[barcoo](https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/documentation/resources/hardware/#ibm-idataplex-x86-system-barcoo) and [snowy](https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/documentation/resources/hardware/#lenovo-nextscale-x86-system-snowy) which have hundreds of cores and a few nodes with very high amounts of memory.

The documentation for using the Melbourne Bioinformatics computational resources
are located [here](https://www.melbournebioinformatics.org.au/documentation/).

## Spartan

[Spartan](https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au/) is The University of Melbourne 
HPC system managed by Research Platform Services.

To get started with Spartan, you will need to [request a Spartan account](https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au/karaage/)
using your University of Melbourne email and apply for a new project or join an
existing project.
