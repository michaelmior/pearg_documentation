## Cloud Servers

These clusters are hosted on the Nectar cloud. Email 
[jchung@unimelb.edu.au](mailto:jchung@unimelb.edu.au) to request an account.

When using these servers you should follow the best practices described in
[these documents]({{%relref "best-practices/_index.md"%}}).

Each server has 10 - 30 TB of storage space which is not backed up.
It is your own responsibility to have 
[backups]({{%relref "best-practices/backing-up-your-data.md"%}}) of your 
important data.

## Spartan

[Spartan](https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au/) is The University of Melbourne 
HPC system managed by Research Platform Services.

To get started with Spartan, you will need to [request a Spartan account](https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au/karaage/)
using your University of Melbourne email and apply for a new project or join an
existing project.

## Nectar cloud

If you want to manage your own VM, you can apply for resources with the 
[Nectar Research Cloud](http://cloud.nectar.org.au/). Unless you're comfortable 
being your own sysadmin, we recommend using the PEARG servers or Spartan before 
this option.
