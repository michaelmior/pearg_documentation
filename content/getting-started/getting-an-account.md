To obtain an account on `mozzie` or `rescue`, email 
[jchung@unimelb.edu.au](mailto:jchung@unimelb.edu.au) and request an account.
Please include your preferred username in the email.

After you SSH into the server, the first thing you should do is change your
password. You can do this with the `passwd` command and follow the prompts.
