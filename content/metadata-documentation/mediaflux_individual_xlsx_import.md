If you prefer, you can choose to add the sample individuals component of your 
sequencing metadata via Excel spreadsheet instead of using the Mediaflux GUI.

This step requires a few steps:

1. Download the template for individual samples
[here](https://swift.rc.nectar.org.au:8888/v1/AUTH_0edd079661d54bc0a0e4fde3b4892362/mediaflux_docs/mediaflux_individuals_template.xlsx).

2. Fill in the Excel spreadsheet with the information from your sequencing library.

3. Send the spreadsheet to Jessica at [jchung@unimelb.edu.au](mailto:jchung@unimelb.edu.au)

4. There might be some back and forth communication in order for the data to be validated.

5. Jessica will import the individuals to Mediaflux to a temporary staged directory. You'll then be asked to confirm that the files look correct.

6. After confirmation, the individuals will be moved to the proper `individuals/` directory.
