The Hoffmann Lab has a system for storing its raw sequencing data. It is 
important you follow the system in place and ensure all your data is properly
labelled and backed up. This is to ensure that sequencing data generated 
at the present time can still be used in future analyses, even if you are
no longer at the lab. Storing our next-generation sequencing data in a 
systematic manner also benefits the whole lab as other lab members can find and 
use data that could be beneficial to their project. Sharing is caring.

The Mediaflux is the service we use to manage our data, with the underlying
storage being hosted by VicNode. With Mediaflux, we can upload sequencing 
libraries into storage located in the cloud, then set comprehenseive metadata 
detailing what was sequenced, where the biological samples are stored, and other
important experimental design information.

To get started using Mediaflux, visit the [Using Mediaflux]({{%relref "using-mediaflux.md"%}})
page.
