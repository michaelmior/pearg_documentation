      <description>When using the PEARG clusters or the Melbourne Bioinformatics clusters, your files and data should be organised according to the convention described here.
Each project should have its own directory located inside your home directory or a shared location. Your project directory name should be meaningful.
Any shared data such as reference genomes and indices should be stored outside your project directory to avoid unnecessary duplication of data.
Check your project directoryAt absolute minimum, please check:</description>

      <description>This document describes best practices for naming files.
I highly recommend you read this Data Carpentary document on file naming.
Be descriptive Good filenames should be precise. For example, a raw FASTQ filename received from AGRF may look something like this:
X54321-1_AB1XXXXXX_GAATTCGT-ATAGAGGC_L007_R2.fastq.gz The filename contains a lot of information which is descriptive to the user and can be easily extracted programatically.
Just by looking at the filename and knowing what each field represents, we have the following information:</description>

Having a Time Machine backup is a good first step, however, you&amp;rsquo;re still at risk in cases where you lose both copies in a house fire or if both your laptop and Time Machine hard drive are stolen.</description>
